üëãüèº

Hi, I'm Francisco Javier Barba Trejo. üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a software engineer üíª graduated from the University of Seville üéì. 

These years I have always tried to combine university with doing projects by my own hand. I love data engineering, something I would like to specialise in tomorrow, and web development at full-stack level.

I am a self-taught and very curious person. I always try to investigate the solution on my own before it is provided to me. I encourage teamwork and always try to manage time in the best possible way, prioritising more important tasks as the first to be executed.

Here's a list of the languages I've used the most in my github repositories:
